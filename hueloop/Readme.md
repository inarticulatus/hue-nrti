<p>

One of the major objectives of HUE was to facilitate the team that would be represent NRTI at Hyperloop Pod Competition. The project is very difficult, and will require a large team. Given the lack domain knowledge, it becomes even more difficult. But we need to start somewhere. And this is the perfect place to start.

The current goal for team HUEloop is to create a design report for the <a href="https://ihpc2020.web.app/">Indian Hyperloop Pod Competition</a> at IIT Madras. 

While the aim is to win the competition, the team is not going to stop its progress. 

For the project in particular, we have three short term goals.

- A Team
- Sponsorship
- Makerspace, as in a physical space with equipment and resources
