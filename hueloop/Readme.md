<p>

One of the major objectives of HUE was to facilitate the team that would represent NRTI at Hyperloop Pod Competition. The project is very difficult, and will require a large team. Given the lack domain knowledge, it becomes even more difficult. But we need to start somewhere. And this is the perfect place to start.

The current goal for team HUEloop is to create a design report for the <a href="https://ihpc2020.web.app/">Indian Hyperloop Pod Competition</a> at IIT Madras. 

While the aim is to win the competition, the team is not going to stop its progress. 

For the project in particular, we have three short term goals.

- A Team
- Sponsorship
- Makerspace, as in a physical space with equipment and resources

The following are the tentative topics which would be the focus for development of the pod.

- Design Description of the Pod.  It has to include the following : 
    - Pod Design Summary (Top Level)
    - Pod Dimensions
    - Pod Mass by Subsystem
    - Pod Payload Capability
    - Pod Materials
    - Pod Power Source and Consumption
    - Pod Navigation Mechanism
    - Pod Levitation Mechanism (if any)
    - Pod Propulsion Mechanism
    - Pod Braking Mechanism
    - Pod Stability Mechanism
    - Pod Aerodynamic Coefficients
    - Pod Magnetic Parameters (if any)
- Predicted Pod Thermal Profile
- Predicted Pod Trajectory with the following :
    - Speed vs Distance
    - Acceleration vs Distance
    - Speed vs Time
    - Acceleration vs Time
    - Temperature vs Time
- Pod Production Schedule
- Pod Cost Breakdown
- Sensor List and Location Map
- Description of Safety Features including :
    - Mechanisms to mitigate a complete loss of power
    - Fault Tolerance of Braking, Levitation and other subsystems
    - Single Points of Failure within the Pod
    - Implementation of the Pod-Stop Command
